Once the routing options are researched, the next decision is how to travel. **private vehicle hire transportation South India scenic route**
### Private Vehicle 
Hiring a private taxi or vehicle provides maximum flexibility and comfort. You can stop wherever you please and set your own pace. However, it is more expensive than public transportation. Making a booking in advance is recommended.
### Public Buses
Government and private buses run regularly between major towns. They are more affordable but have set schedules and stops. For parts of the journey, public transportation can work well paired with private vehicle legs. 
### Hybrid Approach
A hybrid approach combines the affordability of public transportation with the flexibility of private legs. For example, taking the bus from Palakkad to Kothamangalam and then a private vehicle the rest of the way. Both costs and travel time are balanced.
